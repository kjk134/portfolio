#Sean Lawrence - Resume/CV

I'm a front end JavaScript developer based out of Chicago, IL. This is my portfolio. 

I love building awesome websites with React.js, Express.js, Webpack, Handlebars, AWS (Amazon Web Services) and/or jQuery, contributing to open source projects like Mail For Good and learning new technologies and software on a daily basis.

I also travel a lot (you can see where I've been here), and spend my weekends playing guitar, powerlifting, hanging out with my wife, or taking Clementine - my Triump Bonneville T100 - out for a ride around the Great Lakes.
